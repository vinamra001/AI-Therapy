AI Therapy - Mental Health Chatbot
AI Therapy is an AI-powered chatbot designed to support mental well-being. It helps users manage stress, loneliness, and psychological challenges by providing emotional support, stress management tips, and productivity strategies. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand users’ messages and respond with helpful insights.

Project Overview
Purpose
Many people struggle with stress, anxiety, and loneliness but hesitate to talk about their feelings. AI Therapy is designed to offer a safe, non-judgmental space where users can share their thoughts and receive supportive responses, guidance, and relaxation techniques.

How It Works
The user types a message describing their emotions, stress, or workload.

The chatbot analyzes the text using Sentiment Analysis to detect emotions (happy, sad, stressed, etc.).

Based on the analysis, AI Therapy provides personalized responses, such as:

Stress-relief techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing, relaxation exercises)

Focus and productivity strategies (e.g., Pomodoro timer, task prioritization, short breaks)

Motivational and positive reinforcement messages

Encouragement to seek professional help if necessary
